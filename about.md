# A bit about IGNIS AURUM

My name is Jono. I love to learn and make things. For the last few years I have been toing and froing between different hobbies. But I recently discovered metallurgy.

Follow us on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/the.ignis.aurum).

It has been so fun learning about casting, blacksmithing and working with different metals.

Because I am just starting out I am not taking any commissions at the moment, but if you have any great ideas or things you would like to see in modern jewellery, please contact me on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/the.ignis.aurum).
